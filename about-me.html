          <p>As I spend a lot of my time on the computer, the activites that I do on it naturally becomes my hobbies.
            During my <a href="http://www.maplesea.com" target="_blank">gaming</a> sessions, I mostly enjoy playing with my online friends as they help create a comfortable vibe for me to
            have fun and laugh. <br>
            Other than that, I am also a big fan of <a href="https://open.spotify.com" target="_blank">music</a> as I am always listening to them while doing work like assignments.
            The different genres of music from calm and soothing to upbeat electronic music help bring feelings appropriate to the situation for me.<br>
            I also enjoy <a href="https://myanimelist.net" target="_blank">watching anime</a> when I am alone. With its creative storytelling and beautiful visuals, it never fails to immerse me into the 
            fictional worlds created by the creators.<br>
            I always admire and am grateful to all the talented individuals who pursue in creative fields to create wonderful works to the community.

          <p>Other than being online, I like to also take time off the computer for a change of pace. Obviously, I never forget to <a>spend time with my family</a>,
            whether it be having meals together or family outings.<br>
            I also like to take my dog out for <a>walks</a>. Having a company while taking a walk outside and not being alone makes it better.
